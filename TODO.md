Things to do:
- TODO: Make a Renderer that decouples VertexArray class from VulkanManager
- TODO: Exclusive vs Concurrent based on arguments of queue families
- TODO: Use VulkanMemoryAllocator to split up allocations between buffers
- TODO: Every VulkanManager operation not used by VulkanManager should be 'const'
- TODO: What should test units do to ensure a usable API that could work on multiple platforms/architectures
